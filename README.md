## Current State of this Project

This plugin is currently under construction and not production-ready. 

## Figma Design

I‚Äôve created a figma design for the config editor. The design isn‚Äôt fully implemented yet. If you want I can grant you access to the figma files to work together on the design ü•≥!

[**Figma Prototype ‚Üí**](https://www.figma.com/proto/Ip1ZScLgGiaGIDKu7QuHdZ/Editor?node-id=11%3A3&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1)

## Font Config Editor

To run the editor, install the npm modules in both of the root and editor
directories:

```shell
# install npm deps under both dirs:
yarn # npm i
yarn --cwd editor
```

Then run from within the root directory:

```
# start
yarn start # npm run start
```

<br/>
<hr/>

## Install

```shell
yarn add react-awesome-typography
# or
npm install react-awesome-typography
```

<br/>
<hr/>

## Run tests

yarn test # npm run test

# or in watch mode:
